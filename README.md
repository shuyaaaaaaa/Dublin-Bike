### 3. **Stand Availability Visualization:**
See available stands for docking your bike. The stand availability is represented by circles ranging from big (high availability) to small (low availability).

### 4. **Weather Integration:**
Integrates with weather APIs to fetch real-time weather conditions in Dublin, including temperature, pressure, humidity, sunrise, and sunset times.

### 5. **Route Planning:**
Using the random-forest machine learning algorithm, the app provides predictions on bike availability based on past weather data and bike data. Red markers on the map represent available bikes at each station.

## Technical Details:

- **Backend Framework:** The app is built using Flask, a lightweight web application framework.
- **Machine Learning:** The bike availability prediction uses a random-forest algorithm with around 90% accuracy, trained on historical data to provide accurate forecasts.
- **Hosting:** The application is hosted on AWS EC2, ensuring high availability and scalability.
- **Database:** We use AWS RDS for data storage, allowing for efficient data retrieval and consistent performance.
- **API Integration:** The app integrates with various APIs, including weather data providers and Dublin bike data providers.
